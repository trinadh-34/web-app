------Build a flask web app to use a ML model-----------

In this, you will train an ML model on a data set that's out of this world: UFO sightings over the past century, from NUFORC's database.
OBJECTIVE:
      -->  How to 'pickle' a trained model
      -->  How to use that model in a Flask app.
      
For this task, you need two tools: Flask and Pickle, both of which run on Python.

âœ… What's Flask? Defined as a 'micro-framework' by its creators, Flask provides the basic features of web frameworks using Python and a templating engine to build web pages. Take a look at this Learn module to practice building with Flask.

âœ… What's Pickle? Pickle ðŸ¥’ is a Python module that serializes and de-serializes a Python object structure. When you 'pickle' a model, you serialize or flatten its structure for use on the web. Be careful: pickle is not intrinsically secure, so be careful if prompted to 'un-pickle' a file. A pickled file has the suffix .pkl.
